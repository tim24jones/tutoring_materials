Files to create a business card using latex.

Individual card is made and formatted in bscard.tex
Card is tiled onto letter paper in printmulti.tex

bscard takes an image file, for me a QR code generated by QRicket here:
http://qrickit.com/qrickit_apps/qrickit_qrcode_creator_vcard.php
which I saved as QRickit.png in the same directory as bscard.tex.  It can be replaced by a logo, as long as the file has the same filename mentioned in bscard.tex on line 15.
